# TNMD Hackathon Theme 2 - Open Data - ACT Air quality monitoring data

## Introduction

The ACT government is required to report on air quality to monitor compliance with NEPC standards (National Environmental Protection Council). In addition to providing live information from air quality monitoring stations and publishing the data in annual reports, archival data is available through the Australian Govenrment's open data portal: [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-act-https%3A%2F%2Fwww.data.act.gov.au%2Fapi%2Fviews%2F94a5-zqnn/details?q) 

This dataset has the potential to allow users to look more closely into specific events than would be possible using the year-long time series that are published. However the data is described as unverified - meaning that it has undergone minimal or no quality assurance checks. Additionally, there is no summary of what is contained in the dataset.

## Aim

This document will complement the ACT air quality dataset by providing a summary of the contents and range of the data and basic information about the data quality. It also contains some example visualisations focussing on adverse Air Quality events triggered by bushfires to show the potential value of the open access dataset
